# End-to-End-CICD-implementation
End to End CICD Implementation â€” Jenkins Implemented an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for java-based application using Jenkins declarative pipelines which includes various stages such as Build, Unit testing, Static code analysis, SAST, DAST, Creation of Docker Images, Deployment on Kubernetes platform using Argo CD. 

Implementing an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based application using Jenkins declarative pipelines has been a fascinating journey. This pipeline encompasses several stages, from building the application to performing static and dynamic security analyses, creating Docker images, and finally deploying the application on Kubernetes using Argo CD. Below, I'll outline the detailed steps and provide code snippets for each part of this process.

# Step 1: Setting Up Jenkins
First, I set up Jenkins on a server or cloud instance. Jenkins can be installed using various methods, but for simplicity, I opted for the Docker installation method:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts
After installation, I accessed Jenkins through a web browser and followed the initial setup wizard to configure Jenkins.

# Step 2: Installing Plugins
For this CI/CD pipeline, I installed essential plugins:

Pipeline: Enables the creation of Jenkinsfiles.
Git: Allows Jenkins to pull code from Git repositories.
Maven: Automates build processes for Java projects.
SonarQube: Integrates with SonarQube for static code analysis.
Docker Pipeline: Simplifies the creation and management of Docker images.
Argo CD Plugin: Facilitates integration with Argo CD for Kubernetes deployments.

# Step 3: Creating the Jenkinsfile
In the root directory of my Java project, I created a Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages. This file uses declarative syntax for better readability and maintainability.

# Step 4: Configuring Pipeline Triggers
I configured Jenkins to automatically trigger the pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of my Git repository. This can be done in the Jenkins UI under the job configuration settings.

# Step 5: Setting Up Argo CD
To deploy the application on Kubernetes, I set up Argo CD. First, I applied the Argo CD manifest to create the necessary resources:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
Then, I configured Argo CD to sync my application with the Kubernetes cluster.

# Step 6: Continuous Integration and Deployment
With everything set up, pushing changes to the main branch of my Git repository now triggers the Jenkins pipeline. The pipeline builds the application, runs unit tests, performs static and dynamic security analyses, creates a Docker image, and deploys the application to Kubernetes using Argo CD.

# Conclusion
Implementing this end-to-end CI/CD pipeline has streamlined the development process significantly. By automating the build, test, and deployment phases, we've reduced manual errors and increased efficiency. This setup not only ensures the quality of our Java application but also enables rapid iterations and deployments, aligning perfectly with modern software development practices.
